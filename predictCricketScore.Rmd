# Project Proposal: Predict Cricket Score and match winner during a match

## 1. What is the problem you want to solve?
20 overs a side cricket is the short format of a cricket match where each side bats a maximum of 20 overs of 6 legal balls each, and tries to score more runs than the other team. This shortened version of cricket has caught on with the sports fans among all cricket playing nations, and a lot of statistics is now availabe for analysis. Which is perfect because the audience, both on the field and off-field watching on TV, want to guess how each of the two teams playing in a match will fare: how many runs will they score, how fast, which team will win, etc. A particularly popular 20 overs tournament, called IPL T20, is held annually (primarily in India) at different venues and attracts the best cricketers from around the globe, which then brings packed stadiums of spectators and extremely lucrative TV rights.

In this project, apart from predicting the match winner at different stages of an ongoing match, I want to predict each team's scoring rate: specifically how many runs will a team score; I will predict at the end of their 6th over (also called PowerPlay overs due to field restrictions in place allowing batsmen to chance their arms more freely), 10th over, 15th over, and the end of the innings which is either at the end of the 20th over or when 10 of its batsmen are out, whichever happens earlier. I will then predict the same for the other team that bats next chasing its opponent's final score: predict the runs it will end up with, based on the 2nd team's chase at the end of 6th, 10th and 15th overs.And also predict at each of these overs the match winner. 

Based on prediction for runs and other parameters, I will predict the match winner at these stages: a) right after the toss and before a ball is bowled, b) at the completion of the 1st innings of the team batting 1st, c) at the end of 2nd team's power play (6th over), and d) then at the end of 10th and e) 15th over of the 2nd innings. 

Showing these types of predictions during a match is quite common these days, and while I will not be attempting a new solution, this project will help me apply my data science skills to a real world event. 

I am aware of the following caveats which I will investigate if they have a bearing on the predictive model:

  1. Not all teams have participated in all the 10 years for which data will be analyzed. There are a total of 13 teams across the 10 years of Training data. Teams who have not played every year are: 
        Kochi Tuskers Kerala:     2011  only 
        Gujarat Lions:            2016-2017
        Rising Pune Supergiants:  2016, 2017        Pune Warriors:      2011-2013  
        Sunrisers Hyderabad:      2013-2017         Deccan Chargers:    2008-2012  
        Chennai Super Kings did not play in 2016 and 2017. 
        
For the analysis, we will consider Chennai Super Kings as a regular team since they have played in 8 of the 10 years. And I may combine the two Hyderbad-based teams, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Deccan Chargers, to represent one entity, as they are essentially  the same team but with different owners.
        
  2. In 2009, all matches were played in South Africa, not India (different pitches and ground conditions).  
  
  3. The biggest assumption is that even though some of the players have played for multiple teams over the years, for building the score predictive model, I will ignore individuals and concentrate only on team performance. My reasoning is that even though a player may move from one team to another after a couple of years, any team retains majority of its players from one year to the next; a team's composition changes only gradually over years; typically one star player is replaced with another. 

## 2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?
An IPL T20 season typically runs for 45 days with about 8-10 franchises participating. Each franchise has a huge fan following based largely on the region the franchise is located at, but also on specific star cricketers. Matches are held in the evenings after most people have finished their work day and are ready to relax in front of their TV sets. Often whole families watch a match since the matches are shorter, full of excitement and finish around nap time. There are discussions among those watching together about the scores each of the two teams will put up that evening and who will win. Instead of gut, I can provide these eager spectators (and the TV channel carrying the matches) with better guesstimates based on data science applied to historical data. 

So for instance during a match between Mumbai Indians and Delhi Daredevils, fans of both teams, tens of thousands of them, hope their favorite team will score x number of runs and will restrict the other team to less than that. Fans constantly make and revise these predictions as fortunes fluctuate during a match. This frenzy happens every evening during the tournament for more than a month. If I can build a predictive scoring model based on various relevant historical data, such that the score predictions are more accurate than gut-based, TV commentators and analysts will be able to share this information with the spectators before they unfold, and the involved audience will have more realsitic expectations. With each passing year, more data gets generated, and it is not possible for most human minds to synthesize this data to predict scores scientifically without the help of computers. Realistic updates throughout a match, and each match is usually close swinging one way then the other with each over or wicket keeping everyone gripped, makes for a better informed fan and more interactive watching. 

## 3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
Ball-by-ball data for IPL T20 cricket is available for 10 years, from 2008 through 2017, in total 637 matches. It was originally published by cricsheet.org in YAML format. It has been transformed into four csv files by a data sceintist and is publicly available [here](https://data.world/raghu543/ipl-data-till-2017) . While the largest file with 150,450 rows has the ball-by-ball details of each match, the other 3 csv files contain: a) Details at match level: match id, venue, year and date of the match, result, margin of victory, etc.; b) Names of each of the global 495 players who have particpated for the clubs over the 10 years; and c) which player played in which match for which team; this file has about 14,000 rows. Since I am not focusing on players, I will get all my data from only 3 of the 4  files, and ignore Players.csv file. I will use this as the training data, and get 2018 IPL data from a different data [source](https://www.kaggle.com/nowke9/ipldata/insights) to use as Test data. 

## 4. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).
Since historical data will be used to create a predictive model for next year's matches, it becomes necessary to first test the model against historical (training) data. So while some of the 10 year historical data will be used to build the predictive model, another set of the historical data will be used to fine tune the model. We will start with 2008-2014 data, build a predictive model and test a team's scoring pattern with 2015 data. Then use 2008-2015 data and test with 2016 data. Then tweak the model with 2008-2016 data and test against 2017 data. The model will be tweaked iteratively through 2017 data. I will then test the model one final time against the newly aquired and formatted 2018 IPL data. 

I will evaluate what variables are relevant to predicting final scores for each team in a match. Variables under consideration are: 

  1. Runs scored at the end of each over through the 15th over of each innings: called Run Rate
  2. Wickets lost (number of men out) at the end each over: since early wickets lost may impede the scoring rate
  3. Venue : some grounds are conducive to high scoring matches while some suit bowlers more. This variable may require examining two aspects: a) how this team has scored at this venue and b) how all other teams have averaged on this venue
  4. Whether the team is batting first (setting a target) or second (chasing with the target already known)
  5. Result and scoring pattern of this team against today's opponent over the years
  
Some data wrangling would be necessary for this project. e.g. joining across 2 files; summing the scores at the end of each over for each match for each innings. I may pre-sort the two csv files of interest on Season/Year and MatchID columns. In R, I  will then "join" Ball_By_Ball.csv and Match.csv on matchid and Year/Season_Year. Match.csv will provide result of each match, toss winner, and its venue, while Ball_By_Ball.csv file has useful data like Over Id, Ball Id, Number of Runs Scored on each Ball, Did someone get Out on that Ball, and other columns that may not be as relevant. Furthermore, Match.csv provides the Team Ids and the sequence of batting for the two teams, and to get the team names, a "join" to the Team.csv file on Team Id will be done. 

Team.csv will drive the building of data because it has Team Names. It will drive the "join" to Match.csv on Team Id, which wil then "join" with Ball_by_Ball.csv which will provide the scores. 

The final data frame for analysis may look like:

  Team Name                                           (from Team.csv)
  
  Year                                                (from Match.csv)
  
  Match Id                                            (from Match.csv)
  
  Venue                                               (from Match.csv)
  
  Opponent Team Name                                  (from Ball_By_Ball.csv; not from Match.csv)
  
  Batting First ? (TRUE/FALSE)                        (from Ball_By_Ball)
  
  Total Overs batted (in terms of number of balls)    (from Ball_By_Ball)
  
  6 Over stage (Runs Scored, and Wickets Lost), 10 over stage, 15 over stage, End of Innings stage  (computed from Ball_By_Ball.csv)
  
  
  To build the model, the training data list will be expanded in each iteration with the following year's data (i.e., start with 2008-2014 data, then 2008-2015 data, then 2008-2016, etc.). The following year's data wil be the test data (e.g. 2015 when training data set was 2008-2014)
