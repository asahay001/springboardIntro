## Data Exploration

1. My goal for the project is to be able to predict a) the match winner, and b) approximate runs each team will score in the match. The prediction will happen while a match is in progress, at the end of specific overs: for final score of each team, the prediction will be at the end of 6th over (= end of powerplay), and at the end of 10th and 15th overs respctively of each team's batting. Each match winner will be predicted right at the start of the match after the toss, then at the end of Innings 1 before the 2nd team starts its batting, and then at the end of the 26th over, 30th over and 35th overs of the match (which are the same as at the end of 6th, 10th and 15th over of the 2nd innings). 
So while it may be tempting to explore if such milestones have an impact on the prediction, like in which over does a team reaches its 50th or 100th run, or does it matter how soon a team loses its first 4 or 5 batsmen (typically your frontline batsmen), I cannot consider these parameters directly since we dont know beforehand in which over these may happen. So instead I will explore parameters relevant at the start of the match, and then at the end of the specific overs mentioned above. I have to remember that since the predictions are for a live martch, the training data needs to be explored in that context: when I predict at the end of the 6th over, I will explore data only  till the 6th over of innings of previous matches for independent variables; when prediction happens at the end of 10th over, I wil explore data up till the end of 10th over of previous matches. For the 2 dependent variables mentioned above, the independent variables that spring to mind are: 
a) Winner of the most recent previous match between the two teams playing this current match (*who is playng who*)
b) Who has won how many times in their most recent last 3 encounters, and in the last 5 encounters (assuming the team with recent wins agains the same oppostion has an edge in the current ongoing match)
c) where the current match is being played: some teams perform better at certain venues, and also the ground conditions at certain venues may be more amenable to batting, and at some other venues to bowling, meaning teams are likley to post a higher socre in the 1st scenario and a lower score in the 2nd scenario than the average scores (*so who is playing, and where*)
d) Do a significant number of toss winners end up winning the match
e) Similarly, does the data show if it is advantageous t bat forst or to bowl first, or it does not matter
f) runs scored at the end of various overs, the thought being that the prediction will be better deep into a team's batting innings: the higher the number of overs batted, the more accurate the final score prediction
g) Impact of how many runs were scored and how many wickets were lost in the initial overs: 1st 4 overs, 1st 6 overs, 1st 8 overs and 1st 10 overs (half way mark) of each innings. The hypothesis is that if a team loses early wickets, it may not score that many runs by the end, and also if it scores slowly in the beginning (fewer runs in the initial overs), it may be difficult to post a big total at the end of its innings (EOI).

I am ignoring the effects of current weather conditions or if a match is the finals of aseason's tournament, both of which can deviate scores from the norm. I am also ignoring matches that were shortened (< 12 overs each) either due to weather or due to a team collapsing thereby having a quick match decision. 


2. To explore the impact of variables on the final score by a team, I have used: a) Box plots b) Histograms and frequency polygon c) Smooth line using lm method d) Facet wraps 

3. Data exploration is performed on a wrangled data file, read into R as a data frame: each row represents relevant details of each match. The data files are in my github folder: https://github.com/asahay001/springboardIntro   File name: wrangled_matchSummaryDataIPL.csv

4. I have saved the plots in plots.pdf file for you to see. All my files are in the following github directory: https://github.com/asahay001/springboardIntro The R file to produce the plots is called dataExploreMatchScorePrediction.R 

5. Plots show a strong correlation between wickets lost early on (1st 6 overs) with the final score posted by a team. 

6. Running a correlation fucntion for the over stats (independent variables) against the indepenent variable, *Runs Scored By A Team in an innings* shows correlation with EOI Runs (End of the Innings score) is higher as the number of overs played increases; 
*Runs scored* has a *positive correlation with EOI Runs* and *Wickets lost* has a *negative impact* on the End of Innings score:
```{r }
cor(na.omit(subset(matSumm, na.rm = TRUE, 
                select = c("Inn1EOIRuns", "Over2Runs", "Over2Wkts","Over3Runs", "Over3Wkts", 
                            "Over4Runs", "Over4Wkts", "Over5Runs", "Over5Wkts",
                            "Over6Runs", "Over6Wkts" ))))

```

Next, checking the correlation between a team winning a current match with matches won against that same opponent recently, shows that the *last match result is not so consequential as the results over the last 5 matches*; in the result below, the code is checking for the performance of the team that is batting first in this current match with its past results against the same team:
```{r}
matSumm_cor2 <- na.omit(subset(matSumm, na.rm = TRUE, 
                               select = c("TeamBattingFirstWon", "BatFirstWonLastMat", 
                                          "BatFirstWinsInLast3Mat", "BatFirstWinsInLast5Mat" )))
cor(matSumm_cor2)
```



## Feature Engineering:
1. New columns created for data exploration and liner regression models: TeamBatWinner True/False), summary Scenarios at end of 4, 6, 8,10, 12, 15 overs; 6 overs has aspecial significance: PowerPlay; for Overs rounded correctly to 1 decimal place, from Over-Ball data (an over is 6 legal balls, so 2 over and 3 balls means 2.5 overs for plotting, not 2.3 as in cricket parlance)
2. Ball-by-ball detail rows were summarized into rows by innings, since score prediction is by innings


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
